# Colors!

A CLI tool for playing with colors, written in Go.

## Installation

```
go get -u github.com/spilliams/colors/cmd/colors
```

## Usage

All commands have a `--help` flag to show documentation.

```
colors --help
```

The first command here is `contrastRatio` (also `cr`)

It's a work-in-progress.
